# Reputy

As a recent graduate looking for a job, I want to showcase my diverse talents and soft skills to potential employers with minimal effort, allowing me to stand out from other candidates and gain an extra edge in the competitive job market.

As a job seeker creating a CV, I want to present my full potential to employers by highlighting not only my professional achievements but also my hobbies, interests, and lifestyle, enabling me to paint a holistic picture of who I am beyond just my work experience.

As a user, I can allow/disallow Reputy to connect to my social media accounts and other platforms, enabling the app to fetch data and analyze it to help identify my soft skills and creativity from my social presence. This feature provides me with control over the information shared and ensures privacy and consent in leveraging my online presence for professional purposes.

As a user, I want Reputy to analyze my social media and online activity to identify and highlight relevant skills and experiences, allowing me to effortlessly incorporate them into my professional profile. This functionality saves me time and effort in manually curating my CV and ensures that my digital footprint is effectively utilized to enhance my job prospects.

As a user, I want the option to review and approve the skills and experiences identified by Reputy before they are included in my profile, ensuring accuracy and relevance in the information presented to potential employers. This review process empowers me to maintain control over my professional narrative and tailor it to suit specific job opportunities.

As a user, I expect Reputy to provide insights and recommendations for optimizing my online presence to better align with my career goals, offering suggestions for enhancing visibility, engagement, and professionalism across various social media platforms and online communities. This guidance helps me strategically leverage digital platforms to advance my career and showcase my talents effectively.

Additionally, as a user, I value Reputy's potential for expansion and evolution, recognizing that future updates and features may further enhance its usefulness and relevance in supporting my professional journey.
